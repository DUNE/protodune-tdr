  List DocDB notes like:

  note = {LBNE DocDB 1234}

or

  note = {LBNE DocDB 1234-v5}

A note on comments.  EVERYTHING outside of an "at" block is a comment.
You can comment out an "at" block by deleting the "at" character.
Do not put any type of comments inside an "at" block. They are not allowed.

You will see indications below about vol/chapter numbers but the order 
in this file does not actually matter.                  
                  
A note on authors, spell out the full names and separate them with 
the word "and".  If the author list is too long to write everyone then
end it with "and others" and NOT "et al".  The style will take care of 
things like only showing first initial and changing "and others" to 
"et al".  To make anything literal surround it in {}'s.
