\section{Overview}
This chapter of the Technical Design Report is based on documents and plans developed earlier, in particular
on the \textit{Computing Model for the DUNE Experiment} (DocDB 914) -- which contains the description
of the \pd Computing Model as an Appendix section, and \textit{Design of the Data Management System for the protoDUNE Experiment}
(DocDB 1212). The aim was to capture the most important characteristics of the online system being proposed in a concise manner.

Depending on the plan of measurements for \pd (in development at the time of writing), beam characteristics that will be realized
and many other parameters precise estimate of data rates and volume aren't available. However, it is possible to create ranges
of estimates based on a few realistic scenarios, and translate this into requirements for the system configuration, scale and
performance.
