\section{Overview}

This chapter of the Technical Design Report is based on the following two documents:
\begin{itemize}
\item DocDB 914 --  \textit{Computing Model for the DUNE Experiment}  which contains the
description of the \pd Computing Model as an Appendix section

\item DocDB 1212 -- \textit{Design of the Data Management System for the
protoDUNE Experiment}

\end{itemize}

\noindent This chapter outlines  the technical design of the online and offline systems.
The data rate and the total data volume will be the main factors influencing the design choices and scale of \pd
online and offline computing systems.   At the time of writing, a few estimates are available based on
realistic data-taking scenarios.

The following components comprise the overall \pd computing:
\begin{itemize}

\item The online data storage and management system which interfaces the DAQ and which is tasked with buffering
the data and transporing it to mass storage at CERN and beyond, as well basic monitoring of the data as it is collected.

\item The offline system for data distribution, processing, and analysis on the Grid.  The steps envisaged for data processing are: 
calibration, reconstruction, ntuplizing and user analysis.  Multiple passes through this chain will be required for final results as
calibrations, algorithms, and ntuple definitions are expected to evolve.
A fraction of the data will be subject to \textit{prompt processing}, which performs partial reconstruction of the data for QA/QC purposes
with a short turnaround time (see\,\ref{sec:prompt_processing}).

\item  A Metadata and file catalog system.
\end{itemize}
