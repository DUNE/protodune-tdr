\section{HV components}

The TPC high voltage components include the HV power supply, cables,
filter circuit, feedthrough, attachment to the resistive cathode plane
arrays, the HV bus providing low-resistance connections between CPAs,
connections to the field cage, and devices for monitoring steady state
and transient conditions of current and voltage.
