\section{Anode Plane Assemblies}

Anode Plane Assemblies (APAs) are the detector elements utilized to sense ionization created by charged particles traversing the liquid argon volume inside the single-phase TPC.  ProtoDUNE-SP will feature six APAs, arranged in two rows of three, flanking either side of a central cathode plane.  This section describes the initial physics requirements that drive the APA design parameters, and provides a complete description of APA construction and testing procedures.

\subsubsection{Requirements - listing of basic physics requirements}

The initial physics performance requirements that drive the design of the APA are listed in Table \ref{tab:physicsrequirements}.  These are chosen to enable ProtoDUNE-SP to perform high-efficiency reconstruction throughout the entire active volume of the LArTPC, across the broad range of particle momenta and species present in the beam.

The ability to identify minimum-ionizing particles (MIPs) is a function of several detector parameters, including: argon purity, drift distance, diffusion, wire pitch, and Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC).  ProtoDUNE-SP requires that MIPs originating anywhere inside the active volume of the detector be reconstructed with 100$\%$ efficiency.   The choice of wire pitch (i.e., $\sim$5 mm), combined with the design values of the other parameters just mentioned (and described in their respective sections of the TDR), should enable this 100$\%$ efficiency to be achieved for MIPs.


%\fixme{I had trouble getting the gist of this next pgraph; please see rewrite below it}
%Precisely identifying the location of any vertices in an event (e.g., the primary vertex in a neutrino interaction, or gamma conversion points in a $\pi^{0}$ decay) has direct impact on reconstruction efficiency.  The fine granularity of the LArTPC enables excellent performance in this task.  ProtoDUNE-SP requires a vertex resolution such that the fiducial volume, which among other factors determines the number of target nucleons that is a component in cross section measurements, in an analysis can be determined to $<$1$\%$.  This translates into a vertex resolution of $\sim$1.5 cm along each coordinate direction.  In practice, the resolution on the drift-coordinate ($x$) of a vertex/hit will be better than the resolution on its location in the $y-z$ plane, originating from the combination of drift-velocity and electronics sampling-rate.

The fine granularity of the LArTPC enables excellent precision in identifying the location of any vertices in an event (e.g., the primary vertex in a neutrino interaction, or gamma conversion points in a $\pi^{0}$ decay), which has a direct impact on reconstruction efficiency. ProtoDUNE-SP requires that it be possible to determine the fiducial volume (via analysis) to $<$1$\%$, which requires reaching a vertex resolution of $\sim$1.5 cm along each coordinate direction. (The fiducial volume, among other factors, determines the number of target nucleons, which is a component in cross section measurements.) In practice, the resolution on the drift-coordinate ($x$) of a vertex or hit will be better than that on its location in the $y-z$ plane, due to the combination of drift-velocity and electronics sampling-rate.

%Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa1} depicts a diagram of a ProtoDUNE-SP APA.  Each side of an APA consists of three layers of sense wires, plus additional grid and mesh layers.  Collection plane wires (labeled ``X'') span vertically from the bottom of the APA to the top.  There are two planes of induction wires (labeled ``U'' and ``V'') that wrap in a helical fashion, around the long edge of the APA, from the bottom of the APA to the top.  A grid layer (labeled ``G'') also spans from the bottom of the APA to the top, and is not connected for electronic readout.  The mesh layer (labeled ``M'') is secured directly to the APA frame, and effectively defines an equipotential plane over the entire surface area of the frame.  The arrangement of all layers, from the outside-in, is G-U-V-X-M.

The APA layers are listed in Table \ref{tab:bias}, along with their operating voltages.  When operated at these voltages, the drifting ionization follows trajectories around the grid and induction wires, ultimately terminating on a collection plane wire; i.e., the grid and induction layers are completely transparent to drifting ionization, and the collection plane is completely opaque.  The grid layer is present for pulse-shaping purposes, effectively shielding the first induction plane from the drifting charge and removing the long leading edge from the signals on that layer; again, it is not connected to the electronics readout. The mesh layer serves to shield the sense planes from pickup from the Photon Detection System and from ``ghost'' tracks that would otherwise be visible when ionizing particles have a trajectory that passes through the collection plane.

The wrapped style allows the APAs to tile the active area of the LArTPC, minimizing the amount of dead space occupied by electronics and associated cabling.  The size of the APAs is chosen to be compatible with over-the-road shipping, and eventual transport to the 4850 level at SURF, into the membrane cryostat of a detector module.  The dimensions are also chosen such that an integral number of electronic readout channels and boards will fill in the full area of the APA. The modularity of the APAs allows them to be built and tested at off-site production facilities, decoupling their manufacturing time from the construction of the membrane cryostat.  

In the current design of the single-phase DUNE detector module, a central row of APAs is flanked by  drift-fields, requiring sensitivity on both sides. The wrapped APAs allow the induction plane wires to sense drifting ionization originating from either side of the APA.  This double-sided feature is not strictly necessary for the ProtoDUNE-SP arrangement, which has APAs located against the cryostat walls and a drift field on one side only, but it is compatible with this setup as the grid layer facing the wall effectively blocks any ionization outside the TPC from drifting in to the wires on that side of the APA.

Reconstruction of events recorded by the APAs will need to address ambiguities inherent to the wrapped wire design. This can occur when multiple isochronic hits are recorded, potentially leading to reconstructed hits that cannot be traced to unique wire-crossing positions in the detector.  The angle of the induction planes in the APA ($\pm$35.7$^{\circ}$) is chosen such that each induction wire only crosses a given collection wire one time, reducing the ambiguities that the reconstruction must address.  The design angle of the induction wires, coupled with their pitch, was also chosen such that an integer multiple of electronics boards reads out one APA.


The choices of wire tension and wire placement accuracy are made to ensure proper operation of the LArTPC at voltage, and to provide the precision necessary for reconstruction.  The tension of 5~N, when combined with the intermediate support combs that will be described in section \ref{subsec:apa_combs}, ensure that the wires are held taught in place with no sag.  Wire sag can impact the precision of reconstruction, as well as the transparency of the TPC.  The tension of 5~N is low enough that when the wires are cooled, which will increase their tension due to thermal contraction, they will stay safely below the break load of the beryllium copper wire, as described in section \ref{subsec:apa_wires}.  To further mitigate wire breakage and its impact on detector performance, each wire in the APA is anchored twice on both ends, with both solder and epoxy.  Details of this arrangement are provided in section \ref{subsubsec:apa_wire_wrap}.

\subsection{APA Physical Description and Fabrication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Wires}
\label{subsec:apa_wires}

Beryllium copper (CuBe) wire is known for its high durability and yield strength. It is composed of $\sim$98$\%$ copper, approximately 1.9$\%$ beryllium, and a negligible amount of other elements. The DUNE APA wire has a diameter of 150$\mu$m (.006~in), and is strung in varying lengths across the apparatus. Three key properties for usage in the APA are: low resistivity, high tensile or yield strength, and coefficient of thermal expansion suitable for use with the APA's stainless steel frame.

Tensile strength of the wire describes the wire breaking stress (see Table \ref{tab:wire}).  The yield strength is the stress at which the wire starts to take a permanent (inelastic) deformation and is the important limit stress for our usage -- though most specifications give tensile strength.  Fortunately, for the CuBe alloys of interest, the two are fairly close to each other.  Based on the tensile strength of wire purchased from Little Falls Alloy (over 1380~MPa or 200,000~psi), the yield strength will be greater than 1100~MPa.  Given that the stress while in use is around 280~MPa, this leaves a comfortable margin.

The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) describes how material expands and contracts with changes in temperature.  The CTEs of CuBe alloy and 304 stainless steel are very similar.  Integrated down to 87~K, they are 2.7e-3 for stainless and 2.9e-3 for CuBe \fixme{find and add reference to bib file} (from study: ``Cryogenic Material Properties Database'' by Marquardt, Le and Radebaugh of NIST).

Since the wire contracts slightly more than the frame during cool-down the wire tension will go up.  If it starts at 5~N the tension will rise to about 5.5~N when everything is cool.  

The change in wire tension during cool-down could also be a concern.  In the worst case, the wire
 cools quickly to 87~K before any significant cooling of the frame  -- a realistic case because of the differing thicknesses.  In the limiting case, with complete contraction of the wire and none in the frame, the tension would be expected to reach $\sim$11.7 N.  This is still well under the $\sim$20 N yield tension.
In practice the cooling will be done gradually to avoid this tension spike as well as other thermal shock to the APA.

Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_wirelengthvsnoise} shows the intrinsic noise behavior in (plain) stainless steel wire and stainless steel wire plated with copper and gold.  The MicroBooNE TPC uses the plated wire, for example.  CuBe wire has very similar electrical properties to the plated stainless steel wire, and the figure indicates the expected intrinsic noise levels for ProtoDUNE-SP induction and collection wires.  These very low levels of noise are an important factor in the choice of CuBe wire for the APAs.

\subsubsection{APA Frame}
\label{subsec:apa_frame}

\paragraph{Dimensions}

The stainless steel frame of the APA (Figures \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framedrawing} and \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framephoto}) is 6.06~m long, not counting electronics and mounting hardware, and 2.30~m wide.  It is 76.2~mm thick, made from imperial size 3~in $\times$ 4 in $\times$ 0.120 in wall rectangular tubing.  The cross pieces are 2~in $\times$ 3~in $\times$ 0.120~in wall tubing.  It will be mounted in the cryostat with its long axis vertical; multiple APAs will be mounted edge-to-edge to form a continuous plane. An electron deflection technique will be used to ensure that electrons that are drawn towards a joint between two APAs will be deflected to one or the other, and not lost.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_framephoto.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\paragraph{Welded vs. modular construction}

Early prototypes of the APA frame were welded.
Switching to a modular design, however, has improved dimensional accuracy and ease of fabrication; see Figures \ref{fig:tpc_apa_boltedjointdrawing} and \ref{fig:tpc_apa_boltedjointphoto}.  
%Welding distortion, particularly distortion that would worsen the flatness of the APA, is time consuming to avoid.  
Techniques to avoid welding distortion, particularly that which would in turn distort the flatness of the APA, slowed down the fabrication.
The individual tubes now have threaded pads welded to the ends; the pads are machined flat and square (after welding) %so 
and the frame is assembled with machine screws.

Other advantages of this modular construction include easier transportation/shipping of fabricated but unassembled frames, and easier and more economical replacement of a defective frame member. % if one is found to be defective.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Bolted Joint Drawing]{tpc_apa_boltedjointdrawing}{A model of the bolted joint.  The holes on the top of the tube are for access to tighten the screws.  The heads actually tighten against the lower hole, inside the tube.}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_boltedjointphoto.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\paragraph{Wire loads}

The many wires strung across the frame, each with a 5-N tension ($\sim$1.1 lb), apply a large, compressive, in-plane load around the perimeter of the APA.  Finite Element Analysis  (FEA) has shown that the distortions caused by these loads are small, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:tpc_apa_distortion} and \ref{fig:tpc_apa_maxstress}.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Distortion]{tpc_apa_distortion}{Distortion of the APA frame under wire load.  Arrows are not shown across end tubes but loading is present as an evenly distributed load.  The maximum in-plane distortion seen with this loading is under 0.2~mm.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_distortion.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Maximum Stress]{tpc_apa_maxstress}{Analysis of maximum stress due to wire load.  The maximum is 52~Mpa.  The yield stress of 304SS is around 240~MPa. (The stated 351.6 MPa is optimistic!)}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_maxstress.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

%Although the compressive long-direction load has raised concerns about buckling, that is not an issue here:
Buckling from the compressive long-direction load will not be an issue:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The loads at opposite ends do not remain collinear as the frame deforms because the wires are constrained to stay close to the surface of the APA.} \fixme{I don't follow this (AH). Can you clarify? }
\item{If the frame were to start to bow, tilting of the boards that hold the wires would cause a change in wire tension strongly countering that bowing -- opposite of the increasing sort of effects that lead to buckling.} \fixme{would cause the tension to decrease? Again, please clarify}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Other FEA results}
Other FEA studies have been done to verify what hand calculations show: the APA structure is stiff enough to stay well within allowable deformation and stress limits for any expected load.  A few of these are shown in Figures \ref{fig:tpc_apa_distortion_simplesupport}, \ref{fig:tpc_apa_stress_simplesupport}, \ref{fig:tpc_apa_distortion_topcentersupport}, and \ref{fig:tpc_apa_stress_topcentersupport}.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_stress_topcentersupport.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\paragraph{Frame Handling}

All handling of APAs in the factory will be with the long 6-m axis of the APAs in a horizontal plane. Most stations are oriented so that the head end is toward the south, avoiding the large floor space usage that would be required if rotating APAs end for end between one station and another. \fixme{Refer to a figure so that we know what `south' relates to}

Initially (through ProtoDUNE-SP), bare frame assembly will be in the main PSL building, while winding and other assembly will occur in the south building. \fixme{Refer to a figure} A transport cart has been built and will be used to move bare frames to the south building. (During volume production for the full-scale detectors, frame assembly is planned to occur in the south building.)

Bare frames are mounted in carts used both for transport within the production building and as stands in which many fabrication processes occur, such as installing mesh, comb bases, additional combs, boards, and performing soldering and epoxying. These carts are called \textit{process carts}. 

The mounting to the process cart is done using interface frames and trunnion kits that are also used in the wire winder. The trunnion kits provide for rotation to various angles about the APA's long (6-m) axis, and for holding the rotation angle fixed.

A small gantry crane and a set of jack stands are used to aid in supporting one end of an APA, while the interface frame at that end is removed and reversed to enable any of a few different operations, e.g., to wind the other half of a wire layer, %or to allow 
to install more boards at the foot, to support the frame in a minimal-deflection state while applying and bonding mesh or boards, or to assemble and disassemble the large mesh application jig. 

%A large gantry crane is used to move the APA in progress, along with its attached interface frames and trunnion kits, between a process cart and the winder. The rigging equipment used for this move is the vertical rigging kit, a 2-level whiffle tree of spreaders for vertical compactness compared to slings, to make best use of limited hook height and to load the frame at four attachment points to manage stresses in the thin tube walls of the APA frame. 
%
%\fixme{I had trouble with  prev pgraph; here is attempted rewrite of it.}
A large gantry crane is used to move the APA, along with its attached interface frames and trunnion kits, between a process cart and the winder. A two-level whiffletree of spreaders is the vertical rigging kit used for this move.  It affords vertical compactness compared to slings, and will make the best use of limited hook height. It also enables loading the frame at four attachment points, helping to manage stresses in the thin tube walls of the APA frame. 

Another rigging kit, the ``H spreader'', enables lifts when the wire planes are horizontal, e.g., for loading into or removing from a cold test. Formed feet have been designed %for minimal 
in order to minimize tube wall stress when supporting an APA during jack stand use or in a cold test. For temporary storage of work-in-progress APAs, a storage rack has been built with four stations that APAs can be loaded upon. It is designed to remain stable while holding up to four APAs in any combination of stations. % has been built .

When the APA is mounted in the winding machine for applying wire to its surface, it must be mounted in ``landscape'' mode, i.e., short axis vertical, long axis horizontal. % placed horizontally. % and so that it can be rotated about that axis.  
Although winding will always be done with the APA in ``landscape'' position, it must be possible to rotate it about its long axis in this machine in order to perform other tasks that require the APA surface parallel to ground.

In order to hold it securely in both positions and allow rotation between the two positions an ``interface frame'' set (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_interfaceframes}) has been designed that connects to the head and foot of the APA.  It has trunnions at each end  %so the 
to support the APA/interface frame assembly %can be supported 
in bearings.  This interface frame attaches to the APA in such a way that slightly more than half of the width of each end is exposed for winding of wires.  After half a wire layer is wound, the APA is repositioned so that the interface frame connects to the opposite side and the rest of the APA can be wound.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Interface Frames]{tpc_apa_interfaceframes}{A Solidworks model of the interface frames attached to the APA. Trunnions, for mounting in the winding machine, are visible at the ends. Note that the frame is exposed for winding at the tail (top image) end and a temporary toothed board is similarly exposed at the head (bottom image) end.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_interfaceframes.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\paragraph{Effect on in-plane wire spacing of in-plane frame deviations}

The effect of in-plane frame deviations is straightforward.  If features that locate a wire move in a direction parallel to the wire, the wire position is unaffected. If they move perpendicular to the wire then the end of the wire is moved by the same amount -- with a diminishing effect along the wire away from that point. 

Minimizing in-plane deviations hinges on accurate machining of the APA component parts.  If the mounting holes for wire guide boards on the tubes are accurately placed, and if the joining surfaces between tubes are accurately machined, and then if the wire guide boards themselves are accurately machined, these distortions will be minimized.  The deviations in wire position will be similar magnitude to the machining deviations.

\fixme{rewrite of prev 2 pgraphs}
In-plane deviations of the APA frame can arise from less-than-accurate machining of the APA component parts. The effect of in-plane frame deviations is straightforward.  If a deviation occurs in a direction parallel to the wire, the wire position along the frame is unaffected. If it occurs perpendicular to the wire, then the end of the wire is moved by the amount of the deviation -- with a diminishing effect along the wire away from that point.  In-plane distortions will be minimized if the mounting holes for wire guide boards on the tubes are accurately placed, and the joining surfaces between tubes and the wire guide boards themselves are accurately machined.


\paragraph{Effect on layer spacing of the out-of-plane frame deviations.}

In-plane distortions only affect the spacing between wires within a plane.  Out-of-plane distortions are more serious because they affect the spacing between wire planes.  If the spacing is too far from its design value, electrons will be absorbed at induction layers, resulting in a loss of transparency.  Calculations have shown that, %although a millimeter or more of layer plane spacing change can be accommodated by
although a change of %layer 
wire-plane spacing of a millimeter or more can be accommodated by
 adjusting the wire layer voltages, the goal is to keep the wire-plane spacing accurate to within 0.5~mm. 
 \fixme{seems there should be some upper limit, like ``about a millimeter'' or ``a millimeter or two'' rather than ``a millimeter or more''}

Calculations have been done to show the effect on wire-plane spacing of several basic distortions in the APA frame.  The distortions studied were: a twist, a bow along the length, and a fold down the middle. These are illustrated in figures \ref{fig:tpc_apa_twistdistortion}, \ref{fig:tpc_apa_bowdistortion}, and \ref{fig:tpc_apa_folddistortion}).  (A fold between the top half and the bottom half is considered unlikely and a bow across the width would be similar to, but slightly less severe than, the lengthwise fold. These three cases should therefore be %able 
sufficient to approximate a general distortion.)

Although the APA is 6~m long, it is divided into five cells by the steel cross members of the frame.  A series of machined ``combs'' along each of these cross members maintains in-plane and out-of-plane spacing.  The combs isolate deviations in wire spacing in one cell from deviations in the others, and %means that the wire spacing around the edges of these cells is as accurate as 
determines the accuracy of the wire spacing around the edges of these cells; it is equivalent to that of the combs and wire boards bordering the cells.  %We looked at the wire plane spacing effect of the above distortions within a cell and then related that to the distortions of the entire frame.

%orig     For each out-of-plane distortion considered we calculated the deformation of the wire planes and then compared adjacent planes to find the change in wire plane spacing over the entire cell.  This gave plots such as Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_wirespacingchange}.  Looking for the worst effect among the sets of adjacent layers gave us the limits on frame distortion.  We scaled those distortions to give the maximum magnitude of each of these distortions for a 0.5 mm change in wire plane spacing. Fortunately, the three distortions considered have their largest effect on the wire layers in 3 different locations so each of the distortions can be considered separately.  This means if the distortion of a frame is considered as the sum of the three distortion modes, their effect is fairly independent.

For each out-of-plane distortion considered,  the deformation of the wire planes was calculated and then compared with adjacent planes to find the change in wire-plane spacing over the entire cell.  This yielded plots such as Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_wirespacingchange}.  The limits on frame distortion were set by the largest (worst) effect among the sets of adjacent layers.  These distortions were scaled to give the maximum magnitude for a 0.5 mm change in wire plane spacing. \fixme{And what was it?}
The largest effects were found in three separate locations, and if the distortion of a frame is considered as the sum of the three distortion modes, they can be treated independently.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_wirespacingchange.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

%The net results are as follows.  
It was determined that a 0.5 mm change in wire plane spacing could come from:
\begin{itemize}
\item{6 mm overall out-of-flatness in the frame due to twist (1 mm/m of frame length)}
\item{11 mm out-of-flatness due to bow}
\item{1.2 mm out-of-flatness due to a ``fold'' down the center}
\end{itemize}
    
The distortions are  %proportional 
linear, so that 12 mm of twist, or 22 mm of bow, or 2.4 mm of fold would cause a 1.0 mm change in wire plane spacing.

\paragraph{Measured deviation in fabricated frame geometry}

The prototype frame that has been constructed to test the APA fabrication process (the ``process  prototype'') has been surveyed to measure its deviation from ``perfect'' geometry.  This was done with retroreflectors and a Leica TCRA1201+ theodolite (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framesurveyphoto}).

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Frame Survey Photograph]{tpc_apa_framesurveyphoto}{Modular APA frame being surveyed after fabrication.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_framesurveyphoto.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

The two main categories of data are in-plane and out-of-plane distortions. The plot in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framesurvey_inplane} shows the in-plane distortion measured in this frame.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Frame Survey In-Plane Distortions]{tpc_apa_framesurvey_inplane}{Plot of in-plane deviations.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_framesurvey_inplane.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\fixme{More explanation needed in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framesurvey_inplane}. Are we looking end-on at a horizontally oriented plane? Vertical scale is mm and horiz is dm? Or we're looking at landscape view and both are dm but separation of blue and orange dots is mm?  But wouldn't that depend on how big the plot is on your screen or on the page?}

The blue dots in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framesurvey_inplane} show the theoretical locations of several points on the frame; the axes give positions in meters.  The orange dots show the deviation from perfect position, but in mm.  %If there were no deviation the points would be on top of each other; t
The greater the space between the theoretical and measured points, the greater the deviation from perfect.  In this plot the same scale is used on the side, except that the scale now represents millimeters.  So, a point that is measured to be in error by a mm is plotted, in the correct direction, a millimeter (on the plot scale) from the perfect point.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Frame Survey Out-of-Plane Distortions]{tpc_apa_framesurvey_outplane}{Plot of out-of-plane deviations in the measured process prototype.  The deviations range from a low of -2.14 mm to a high 1.35 for a total out-of-flatness of 3.5 mm.}

\end{cdrfigure}

The plot in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framesurvey_outplane} shows the measured out-of-plane deviations.  To avoid out-of-plane distortion of the frame by gravity the frame was held for survey by two points along the bottom rail and by one point near the top edge that kept it from falling over (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_framesurveyphoto}) but was not tight enough to twist or bend the member to which it attached.  All of the points on the measured surface fall between two planes 3.5 mm apart.

The measured twist in each cell is shown; the allowable twist (for a 0.5 mm wire plane spacing change) is greater than any of these.  The overall bow is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_calculateddistortion}; the allowable is greater than this.

\subsubsection{Wire and Wire Wrapping}
\label{subsubsec:apa_wire_wrap}

\paragraph{Geometry}

Each side of the APA frame is covered with four layers of wires.  Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_cornerphoto} shows a corner of the APA and the four layers.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Corner Photograph]{tpc_apa_cornerphoto}{Corner of an APA.  The wires in the first and fourth layers on each side are parallel to the long axis of the APA.  The second and third layers are angled at 35.7$^{\circ}$ to this axis, angled in opposite directions to each other.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_cornerphoto.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

All the wires start at the top end (right hand end in Figure~\ref{fig:tpc_apa1}) \fixme{not top of that figure?} of the APA and stop at the bottom. The first and fourth layers go straight; the second and third wrap around the sides. 

During fabrication, wires are wound around the bottom and the top %without break.  
in a continuous pattern. Wire segments at the top and bottom are snipped out after winding to create individual wires.  This continuous winding process is more efficient than stopping to solder, trim and restart each wire as it is placed.

\paragraph{Head Electronics Boards}

The head electronics boards (referred to as ``wire boards'') are the anchors for the wires at the head end of the APA (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_wireboardheadphoto}).  They are also the connection between the wires and the data acquisition electronics -- usually called the cold electronics

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Wire Boards at Head Photo]{tpc_apa_wireboardheadphoto}{The wire boards at the head of one of the 35T APAs.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_wireboardheadphoto.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

All APA wires are terminated on the wire boards. The wire boards are stacked along the Electronics end of the APA frame. Attachment of the wire boards begins with the X plane. After the X-plane wires are wound around the frame, they are soldered and epoxied to the wire boards and trimmed. The remaining wire board layers are attached as each layer is wound.  The CR boards, which provide DC bias and AC coupling to the wires, are attached to the bottom of the wire board ``stack" of all layers.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Board Stack]{tpc_apa_boardstack}{View of the APA wire board stack, as seen from the top (left) and bottom (right).  The G-plane filter board and CR board are also both visible.}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_boardstack_top.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_boardstack_bottom.png}
\end{cdrfigure}
The outer-most G-plane wire boards connect adjacent groups of four wires together, and biases each group through an R-C filter. The filter components are located on daughter boards that are attached after the wire plane is wound. The remaining three layers of wires are connected to the Cold Electronics modules either directly or through DC-blocking capacitors. The X and U planes have wires individually biased through 50-Megohm resistors. Electronic components for the X- and U-plane wires are located on a common CR board.

Mill-Max pins and sockets provide electrical connections between circuit boards within a stack. They are pressed into the circuit boards and are not repairable if damaged. To minimize the possibility of damaged pins, the boards are designed so that the first wire board attached to the frame has only sockets. All boards attached afterward contain pins that plug into previously mounted boards. This process does not leave any pins exposed to possible damage during winding, soldering, or trimming processes.

There are ten stacks of wire boards installed across the width of each side at the head of the APA.  The X layer board in each stack has room for 48 wires, the V layer has 40 wires, the U layer 40 wires and the G layer 48.  Each board stack, therefore, has 176 wires but only X, V and U are signal layers so there are 128 signal channels in each stack.  With a total of 20 stacks per APA, this results in 2560 signal channels per APA and a total of 3520 wires starting at the top of the APA and ending at the bottom.  There is a total of $\sim$23.4 km total of wire on the two surfaces of each APA.  

At the head end of the APA the wire plane spacing is set by the thickness of these wire boards.  The first layer wires solder to the surface of the first board, the second layer wires to the surface of the second board, etc.  Temporary toothed edge boards beyond these wire boards align and hold the wires until they are soldered to pads on the wire boards.  After soldering the sections going up over the temporary boards are snipped away.

Many of the capacitors and resistors that could be on these wire boards are moved to an auxiliary board (the ``CR board'') to improve their accessibility in case of component failure.  This board rests beneath the wire boards at the top of the frame and links the wire boards to the cold electronics.  Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_electronics_connectiondiagram} depicts the connection between the elements of the APA electrical circuit.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Wire Board Connection to Electronics]{tpc_apa_electronics_connectiondiagram}{Diagram of the connection between the APA wires, the various wire boards within a stack, the CR board, and the cold electronics}.
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_electronics_connectiondiagram.png}
\end{cdrfigure}

\paragraph{CR Boards}

The CR boards carry a bias resistor and a DC-blocking capacitor for each wire in the X and U planes. They are attached to the board stacks after fabrication of all wire planes.  Electrical connections to the board stack are made though Mil-Max pins that plug into the X-plane wire boards. Connections to the Cold Electronics (CE) modules are made through a pair of 96-pin Samtec connectors.Surface-mount bias resistors on the CR boards have resistance of 50 Megaohms are constructed with a thick film on a ceramic substrate. Rated for 2.0 kV operation, the resistors measure 0.12 x 0.24 inches. Other ratings include operation from -55 to +155 C, 5-percent tolerance, and 100 ppm/C temperature coefficient.The selected DC-blocking capacitors have capacitance of 3.9 nF and are rated for 2.0 kV operation. Measuring 0.22 x 0.25 inches across and 0.10 inches high, the capacitors feature flexible terminals to comply with PC board expansion and contraction. They are designed to withstand 1000 thermal cycles between -55 and +125 C. Tolerance is 5 percent.

In addition to the bias and DC-blocking capacitors, the CR board includes two R-C filters for the bias voltage. The resistors are of the same type used for biasing except with a resistance of 2 Meg-ohms. Capacitors are 47 nF at 2 kV. Very few choices exist for surface-mount capacitors of this type and they are exceptionally large. Currently the plan is to use Polyester or Polypropylene film capacitors that are known to perform well at cryogenic temperatures.All circuit boards on the APA frame utilize halogen-free FR-4 substrates with lead-free metal finishes. Conformal coatings are being considered but it is not clear conformal coatings will be used. If they are not, requirements for cleaning and handling the circuit boards are likely to be stringent due to the very low leakage currents allowed, less than 0.5 nA at full bias voltage.

\paragraph{Side and foot boards}

The boards along the sides and foot of the APA have notches, pins or other location features to hold the wires in the correct position as they wrap around the edge from one side of the APA to the other.

G10 circuit board material is ideal for these side and foot boards for its physical properties alone but it has an additional advantage.  There are a number of hole or slot features in the edge boards providing access to the underlying frame.  In order that these openings are not covered by wires the sections of wire that would go over the openings are replaced by traces on the boards.  After the wires are wrapped, the wires over the opening are soldered to pads at the ends of the traces and the section of wire between the pads snipped out (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_sideboardmodel}).  These traces are easily and economically added to the boards by the many commercial fabricators who make circuit boards. \fixme{I would like to have the author describe this to me. I'm getting confused. (Anne)}

For its physical properties alone G10 circuit board material would be ideal for these side and foot boards, but it has an additional advantage.

In order that these openings are not covered by wires the sections of wire that would go over the openings are replaced by traces on the boards.  After the wires are wrapped, the wires over the opening are soldered to pads at the ends of the traces and the section of wire between the pads snipped out (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_sideboardmodel}).  These traces are easily and economically added to the boards by the many commercial fabricators who make circuit boards.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Side Board Model]{tpc_apa_sideboardmodel}{Model of board with wires showing how traces connect wires around openings in the side boards.  The wires are wound straight over the openings, then soldered to pads at the ends of the traces.  After soldering the sections between the pads are trimmed away.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_sideboardmodel.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

Originally, notches were machined into the circuit boards but this was labor intensive.  An alternate method has been developed based on the injection molding of strips with the required notch or pin features and then bonding these strips to the edge of the circuit boards as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_sideboardphoto}.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Side Board Photo]{tpc_apa_sideboardphoto}{Boards with injection molded tooth strips glued on.  The left shows an end board with teeth for locating the longitudinal wires.  The teeth there form small notches. The right is a side board for locating the angled wires where the wires are angled around a pin.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_sideboardphoto.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

The angled wires are located by pins as shown in the right-hand picture of Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_sideboardphoto}.  The wires make a partial wrap around the pin is they change direction from the face of the APA to the edge.  The longitudinal wires aren't pulled to the side so they can't be pulled against a pin.  They are located by teeth with slots as shown in the left-hand picture in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_sideboardphoto}. 
	
The polymer used for the strips is Vectra e130i (a trade name for 30$\%$ glass filled liquid crystal polymer or LCP). It retains its strength at cryogenic temperature and has a CTE similar enough to G10 that differential expansion/contraction is not a problem.

\paragraph{Glue and solder}
The ends of the wires are soldered to pads on the edge or wire boards.  Solder provides both an electrical connection and a physical anchor to the wires.  As an additional physical anchor the wires are glued for roughly 10 mm near the solder pads.  For example, in Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_sideboardphoto}, in addition to soldering the wires upon the pads shown on the left-hand photograph, an epoxy bead will be applied on top of all wires in the area between the solder pads and the injection molded tooth strips.

2216 gray epoxy by 3M was chosen for the glue.  It is strong, widely used (therefore much data is available), and it retains good properties at cryogenic temperatures.  A 62$\%$ tin, 36$\%$ lead and 2$\%$ silver solder was chosen.  A eutectic mix (63/37) is the best of the straight tin/lead solders but the 2$\%$ added silver gives better creep resistance.

Tests showed that 3 mm long solder pads were not long enough to hold well so the pad length has been increased to 7 mm.  Increasing the cure time (and/or cure temperature) ensures that the glue develops its full strength.  With these modifications good glue and solder holding has been obtained.  Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_creepdata} shows the results of long term tests performed in which wires were constrained by glue, solder or both and their tensions measured over time. (Note: The wobbly traces came from an experimental problem with measuring tension in some of the wires.)  There is some tension loss over time but the key feature to this plot is that all the wires, glue only, solder only, or glue and solder lost tension at the same rate.  If the joints were slipping it would be highly unlikely that the glue only, solder only and both together joints would all slip at the same rate.  This means that the joints are not slipping but, instead, there is stress relaxation in the wires.

Indeed, CuBe wire is known to exhibit some stress relaxation.  The plot in fig. \ref{fig:tpc_apa_creepdata} shows that over 430 days the wire samples (initially tensioned to 10 N, twice the DUNE APA value) lost around 5$\%$ of their tension.  This does not appear to happen quite linearly; the rate of tension loss decreases over time.  (After the last results were taken it was realized that the warm day without the AC on in the room may have lowered the tensions slightly; these tests are ongoing.)

Interestingly, wire samples with an initial tension of 5 N, the target DUNE APA tension, lost about 4$\%$ over the same time interval -- not much less than the wires tensioned to 10 N. 

These results suggest that using solder alone may be adequate.  However, unless further, conclusive testing confirms this, glue will be used in addition to solder. 

The company that makes the wire, Little Falls Alloy, also makes a wire called ``hard'' which means it has been annealed and mechanically hardened without the heat treatment that would further harden it.  In our tests (see the data for Test 4) the stress relaxation only causes about 1$\%$ tension loss.  Although this is desirable, it comes with a cost; the yield strength is only 10 N or so.  This makes the wire more vulnerable to damage.  The tempered wire, with a yield of 20 N, seems a better choice

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Tension Creep Data]{tpc_apa_creepdata}{Plots of tension vs. time over 430 days for wire strung at an initial tension of $\sim$10 N.  Three methods of fastening the ends were used as shown.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_creepdata.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

\paragraph{Mesh and mesh application}

The mesh layer is glued directly to the steel frame surface -- over the openings in the frame.  It creates a uniform ground layer beneath the wire planes.  In the demonstration 35 ton experiment the APA without mesh showed more noise than the ones with mesh.

The mesh is clamped around the perimeter of the opening and then pulled tight (opening and closing clamps as needed during the process).  When the mesh is taut a 25 mm wide strip is masked off around the opening and glue is applied through the mesh to attach it to the steel.  Although measurements have shown this gives good electrical contact between the mesh and the frame, a deliberate electrical connection will also be made.  Figures \ref{fig:tpc_apa_meshphoto}, and \ref{fig:tpc_apa_meshclampphoto} show the mesh for the 35 ton experiment, while Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_fullsizemeshdrawing} depicts the mesh application setup for a full-size ProtoDUNE-SP APA.

\paragraph{Modular Electronics}
In the current design (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_electronicsmountingphoto}), which was used for the 35 ton demo APAs, the cold electronics boards are mounted on a ``fin'' -- a steel plate extending across the width of the APA at the top tube.

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Electronics Mounting Photo]{tpc_apa_electronicsmountingphoto}{A mockup of the current cold electronics mounting where the cold electronics is mounted on the fin at the head of the APA.}

\end{cdrfigure}

A modified design (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_electronicsmountingdiagram}) is being developed for the ProtoDUNE-SP APAs that consists of small boxes, one near each board stack, that hold the cold electronics for that board stack.  Putting the electronics in small modules simplifies installation and replacement and also helps with the collection of argon gas generated by the warm electronic components.  These modules are mounted in such a way that any of them can be removed from a single side of the APA after APA installation.

\subsubsection{Wire supports on inner frame members - combs}
\label{subsec:apa_combs}

\paragraph{Purpose}

Some wire segments are long.  The longitudinal wires extend from one end of the APA to the other without going around a side -- a length of 6 m.  Even the diagonal wires across the middle of the APA are 3.9 m long.  To prevent deflection from gravity, electrostatic forces, or liquid drag from moving argon, the wires are supported at regular locations along the length of the APA.  This is done with ``combs'' mounted on each of the four cross braces that are ~ evenly spaced along the length of the APA.  This keeps the longest unsupported wire length under 1.6 m.

The nominal wire tension is 5 N but even the 1.6 m long wires could fall to 3 N of tension before the wire, held horizontally, would deviate 150 microns -- one wire diameter.  In operation the wires are either vertical or 35.7$^{\circ}$ from vertical so the actual deviation would be less.

\paragraph{Geometry}

The combs are made from 0.5 mm thick G10 with slots cut into it.  The comb for the lowest layer is glued to a base strip that's glued to the frame.  After each layer is wound another comb strip is glued to the tips of the teeth of the previous one to locate the wires in the next layer.  Each successive comb holds the previous layer of wires in the bottom of their slots (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_supportcombmodel}).

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Support Comb Model]{tpc_apa_supportcombmodel}{A model of the combs showing how they stack.  After winding a layer the comb for the next layer is put in place.  Each comb hold the wires from the previous layer in their slots.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tpc_apa_supportcombmodel.png} 
\end{cdrfigure}

Periodic holes along the length of the strip allow the use of pins to accurately locate each successive strip with the previous one.  A series of jigs are used to create and install these combs.  One jig aligns the first strip to the base strip during gluing.  Another jig locates this assembly on the frame as it is glued in place. A third jig locates each successive comb using the previously mentioned registration holes.

The wire openings in the comb stack are small enough that the wires are accurately positioned at the combs.  They are not, however, deliberately glued at the combs.  This raises the question of whether motion or vibration could cause the somewhat abrasive fiberglass comb to ``saw'' through a wire.  To address this concern we ran a test where wires were mounted on a long tube going through combs (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_wireweartestphoto}).  The tube was then mounted on a device that rotated it on its long axis.  After many more rotations than the wires will ever see, the wires were removed and examined.  No cases were found of significant erosion of the wire.  The only handling that could, possibly, yield this number of cycles would be vibration during travel.  A shipping suspension with low transmissibility at these higher frequencies will be used to prevent this kind of vibration from moving the wires against the combs

\subsubsection{APA Interconnect Features}

Some sort of constraint is needed between adjacent APAs to keep them in plane with each other.  It is also important that this constraint not apply a vertical load to adjacent APAs.  The constraint therefore takes the form of a pair of pins protruding from one edge of the APA (one high and one low on the APA) and a pair of matching slots on the other edge to engage the pins (Figure \ref{fig:tpc_apa_pinslotdrawing}).

\begin{cdrfigure}[APA Interconnect Drawing]{tpc_apa_pinslotdrawing}{The pin/slot constraint.  The pin screws into an insert in the outside frame member of one APA and engages a slot in the outside frame member of the adjacent APA.}

\end{cdrfigure}

Electronic noise concerns have made it desirable to isolate APAs from each other.  To help with that this alignment pin, although it will have a steel core for strength, will have a G10 sleeve where it contacts the frame of the adjacent APA.

\subsubsection{Test plan during production}

Each ProtoDUNE-SP APA will be subject to a testing program during production that will demonstrate their compliance with the design and manufacturing requirements for the experiment.  Given the large size of the APAs, and the highly specialized cryogenic and electronic infrastructure necessary for their designed operation, the testing plan followed during production is necessarily targeted at those features of the APAs which can be addressed prior to final installation in the cryostat.  A separate suite of testing, in a cryogenic environment, is planned to be conducted at CERN, as described in ???? \fixme{is there a section in the TDR for this cold-box test?}.

The tests described in this section will be conducted on APAs during construction, as well as on completed APAs.  Subcomponents ($e.g.$ - wire boards, BeCu wire, etc..) are verified or tested by the appropriate vendor or subsystem manager prior to their use in APA construction.  Each APA will be subject to the testing listed in Table \ref{tab:apatesting}.   Many of the tests (e.g. - tension, continuity, isolation, position survey, bias voltage) are repeated as each successive wire layer of the APA is added, testing the newly installed wires as well as spot-checking wires from previously installed layers. The summary of the tests on each APA, and the associated data collecting during the tests, are recorded in a traveler.

\paragraph{Tension Survey}

Wire tension is a critical parameter in the performance of the APA, and needs to be strictly controlled to ensure the detector will be robust to operation in a cryogenic environment.  As each wireplane layer is added to the APA, and before the next layer is added and restricts access, the tension of every newly added wire will be measured.  Any wire that is more than 1.0 N out of tolerance from the design value of 5.0 N will be removed and, if possible, replaced.  The tension measurement is performed using a laser-photodiode system, developed at PSL and integrated into the wire-winding apparatus, which will record the resonant frequency of a plucked wire.  Visible checks will also be made during production to identify any noticeably sagging wires.  Spot checks of tension will also be made after cryogenic testing at the production site, as well as at CERN prior to insertion of an APA into the protoDUNE cryostat.  


\paragraph{Electrical Continuity Test}

The electrical connection of each APA wire to the cold readout electronics must be verified to ensure a minimum ($<$0.5$\%$) of un-reachable channels in the completed detector.  Un-reachable wires (e.g. originating from cold solder joints or wires that are broken but held in place by epoxy bead) are distinct from clearly broken wires (e.g. obvious strands of wires hanging loose from the APA) which will be removed/replaced during production.   In addition to providing a pathway to record detector signals, wires receive their bias voltage via their connection to the readout electronics, which shapes the electric field in the anode region.  As such, disconnected wires impact the signals that surrounding channels will collect.  As each wireplane layer is added to the APA, and before the next layer is added and restricts access, the electrical connection of every newly added wire to the corresponding wire-bonding board will be verified.  Using a multimeter, or other equivalent methods, the continuity will be verified by directly probing between the ``bottom" end (i.e. - the end that terminates on the non electronics-plate end of the APA) of the wire and the signal trace on the wire-bonding board at the ``top" end (i.e. - the end that terminates on the electronic-plate end of the APA).  Any wire that fails this continuity test, by producing a resistance $>$ 500 $\Omega$ (using 4.4 $\Omega$/m resistance for BeCu wire that is 7.5 m long, and allowing margin for additional parasitic resistance), will be removed and, if possible, replaced.  Spot checks of continuity will also be made after cryogenic testing at the production site, as well as at CERN prior to insertion of an APA into the protoDUNE cryostat.

\paragraph{Electrical Isolation Test}

Each wire of the APA should be electrically isolated from every other wire, in order to avoid shorting out channels and potentially damaging the readout electronics.  Shorted-out wires will also impact the electric-field uniformity in the anode region, and can impact signals in surrounding channels.  Using a multimeter, or other equivalent methods, the isolation between each APA wire and adjacent wires will be measured and verified to have resistance $>$ 1 M$\Omega$.  Since a given wire has many adjacent wires, a dedicated circuit designed to expedite this test will be desirable.  Any wire failing this test will be removed and, if possible, replaced.  Visible checks will also be made during production to identify any touching wires.  Spot checks of isolation will also be made after cryogenic testing at the production site, as well as at CERN prior to insertion of an APA into the protoDUNE cryostat.


\paragraph{Wire Position Survey}

Knowledge of the position of every wire in the APA is required in order for physics analysis of data to be successful.  This information is utilized to create a description of the detector geometry inside the simulation software, and is the basis on which reconstruction algorithms are built. The preliminary description of the geometry assumes a perfect detector built according to the APA design drawings.  Any deviations from this design in the final as-built APAs needs to be incorporated into the software geometry.  All wires should be surveyed during production to verify they are within 500 $\mu$m of the design location.  This survey is partially accomplished by verifying the APA flame flatness is within specifications, and that the wire-bonding boards and support combs are located upon the frame in the desired position.  The APA will be surveyed using a Cognex camera integrated into the winding machine.  The camera employs machine vision to identify each pin/tooth on the installed wire-bonding boards, and from this data a map of wire location will be generated.  This survey should be performed as each wireplane layer is added to the APA, and before the next layer is added and restricts access.  Any wire that is more than 500 $\mu$m from the nominal location, according to survey data, should be inspected and if found to have problems, removed and replaced.  Visual checks throughout the wire-winding process will also be performed to identify any wires that appear out of place.

\paragraph{Bias Voltage Test}

All wires on the APA must be able to reach their design bias voltage in order to achieve the desired electric-field uniformity and transparency conditions required for successful LArTPC operation.  Inability to reach the desired voltage could be an indication of component failure on the CR boards, or of wires in the APA being shorted out.  The CR boards should be tested prior to their installation on the APA to verify they can be biased to 100$\%$ of the largest operating voltage of any anode layer (e.g. the Collection layer's 820 V).  The components selected for the CR boards are chosen with margin about this operating point, to allow for bias voltages in the as-built detector to be adjusted, either for signal-shaping studies or for systematic studies of detector performance at various drift-field values.  As each wireplane layer is added to the APA, and before the next layer is added and restricts access, each newly added wire-bonding board should be connected to a CR board and biased to 100$\%$ of the largest operating voltage of any anode layer.  Any unexpected current draws observed will be traced to the originating wire(s), and if necessary, the offending wire(s) will be replaced.  Visual checks should also be performed during this test to verify that wires being biased do not deflect or move in any unexpected manner.  This test may be augmented when multiple wireplane layers are available, to verify that wires in adjacent layers do not develop unexpected cross-talk when biased.

\paragraph{Cryo Test}

The completed APAs must be robust to operation in a cryogenic environment.  Wires must be able to withstand the cooldown to liquid argon temperatures.  In order to verify the workmanship of each APA, a cryogenic test will be performed as each APA is completed and before shipment to CERN.  The APAs will be placed in a custom-built cold box, where they will be gradually cooled (at a rate consistent with requirements on keeping wire tension increases below a safe level) to $\sim$100 K (exact value to be determined).  The default plan is to use cold gas from a LN supply for this test, and flush gas through the cold box until it reaches the desired temperature.  The APA will be arranged in a horizontal orientation, as this simplifies the engineering of the cold box.  It is not anticipated that loading on the APA/wires due to gravity (e.g. from horizontal vs. vertical orientation) will lead to any significant changes in wire tension, and the frame will be supported appropriately.  The APA will be inspected after this cold test to verify that no wires have broken.  Spot-check tests of tension/continuity/isolation/bias will be performed to verify if any channels have changed relative to their pre cold-test values.  Criteria for acceptance after this test (e.g. number of problematic wires identified by this test) are under development.


\paragraph{Testing at CERN}

Upon arrival at CERN, and prior to integration with interfacing subsystems (e.g. - light collection and electronics), each APA will be subjected to visual inspection, and spot-check ($\sim$10$\%$ of total channels) tests for wire tension, continuity, isolation, and bias voltage will be performed and compared to the equivalent pre-shipping values.
