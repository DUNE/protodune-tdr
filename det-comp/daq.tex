This section outlines the data acquisition system for ProtoDUNE.
The DAQ system is shown in figure \ref{fig:daq-overview} along with its
interfaces to the cold electronics, beam instrumentation, and online
computing systems.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \subsection{Introduction}

%\emph{GB:}

%Brief overview of requirements for the collection of data for the
%primary goals.  (what subdetectors exist (TPC, PDS, trigger, beam
%counter monitoring, is there a beam position monitor (wire chamber or
%fiber detetor in the beam), a cosmic veto, a beam halo veto?  If so,
%who is doing these things?), primary readout scheme, alternative readout
%schemes including FELIX (section~\ref{ssec:daqfelix}) what the data rates
%are for the beam, need for calibration etc.).  Description of modes of
%operation (triggered, extended test modes for far detector).

%Overview of how the DAQ will be commissioned (importance of online monitor
%early (and therefore need early definition of data format and simulation).

%Diagram: Physical connections between the main modules, showing the RCEs,
%FELIX, SSPs, and some generic beam detector readout.  Show timing system
%and show exiting arrows for where data are feeding the slow control.
%Have the offline as a generic blob (i.e. details of data distribution
%are in a different section)

%Descrine the above diagram.  Give table of rates in each branch, and make
%the comments on the data rates (i.e. anticipate questions the reviewers
%may have about bottlenecks).


The requirements for the DAQ system for ProtoDUNE are defined
by the physics requirements of the experiment, with constraints from the
front-end electronics and assumed bandwidth and storage requirements
from the online and offline computing systems.  The baseline trigger
rate during the SPS spill is taken to be 25 Hz.  Cosmic data will also
be acquired at a rate of approximately one third of the beam rate.

The data rate from the electronics is assumed to be dominated by the
TPC data.  However, the photon detection system may be a significant
bandwidth contribution, particularly when reading out calibration data
(where full waveforms are extracted).  \fixme{need real numbers for SSPs}.
The TPC data is sent via the Warm Interface Boards on the cryostat flanges
for the six APAs of ProtoDUNE untriggered at a total rate of 491.52 Gb/s
(6 APAs $\times$ 2560 channels $\times$ 16 bit ADC $\times$ 2 MHz).
ProtoDUNE will have 24 SSPs reading out the Photon Detection System at
a maximum rate of 1 Gb/s each.

The maximum bandwidth from the ProtoDUNE online system to CERN IT (and
hence, the offline world), is considered to be 20 Gb/s at a maximum.
Therefore, the DAQ system must reduce the data by a significant fraction
before the data is sent offline.  This is achieved by a combination of
data compression and triggering.

\subsection{Timing and Trigger}

The timing and the trigger are two distinct subsystems.  The timing
system provides the distribution for the trigger signals over the same
fabric as the clock and calibration signals.  Each of the systems will
be described separately, along with a brief section on the interface to
the beam instrumentation.

\subsubsection{Timing}

\fixme{Bristol to add - should include reference to the endpoints -
WIB,RCE,SSP,FELIX}


\subsubsection{Trigger}

\fixme{Need to finalise group on this soon - possibly UPenn and others}

\subsubsection{Beam Interface}

The Beam Instrumention is described in section \ref{sec:beaminstruments}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{TPC data reduction and collection}

\fixme{ 
        %\emph{GB:} 
        Present the RCE system - just the main data flow, merging,
compression etc.  State that the way the data ae collectd together,
timing system, control etc., will be handled in section~\ref{sec:daq},
sentence at the end to say that the architecture allows future
readout schemes to be incorporated and tested with ProtoDUNE and
that these will be discussed, in particular the FELIX system, in
subsection~\ref{ssec:daqfelix} }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{PDS data reduction and collection}

\fixme{The photon people like consider the SSPs as
electronics, not DAQ, so that may all be in the photon section - KH}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{Event building software and DAQ computing farm }

\fixme{ %\emph{KH:}
        artDAQ is briefly described in section~\ref{ssec:daqonlineinterface}
but I think we need it in more detail here.  By contrast the online
computing infrastructure should be left for the computing section.

%\emph{GB:}

Describe artDAQ, data handling caapbabilities, current plans, extensions
forseen for final DUNE, throughput tests already made and planned.
Control of artDAQ processes (DAQIFACE), error handling, debugging
emulation mode.  }


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{User control interface}

\fixme{\emph{KH:} Requires some more discussions on the run control software
        choices,  artDAQ, WinCC/JCOP etc.
\emph{GB:} (a.k.a. run control) [Before writing,
it would be good to clarify the relationship between the two options
(1) Erik Blaufuss's ICECUBE philosophy to put all run conrol into one
browser interface with one authentication point, which is excellent
and (2) either CERN WIN-xx or EPICS/CAA uBooNE system which are off
the shelf environments.   How to decide - want biggest team of people
with >30\%fTE + commitment to be at CERN for ~3months over next 2 years,
and then let them decide]}


\subsection{Monitoring}

\fixme{Here describe the online and nearline monitoring frameworks and
a non-exhaustive list of what is being monitored.  Who will write this?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsubsection{Alternative readouts - FELIX} \label{ssec:daqfelix}

\fixme{
Short paragraph saying that alternative readouts can be tested by
replacing or adapting the WIBs to feed new systems.  A particular
development which we want to persue vigerously is the FELIX system
developed by a consortium incluing CERN, BNL, NIKHEF for ATLAS and for
which all of these groups and PNNL are persuing for DUNE.   However, it
is not a requirement that this readout is operating on day 1 of ProtoDUNE.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsubsection{Other detector readout}

\fixme{
When groups are known, describe how integration of beam counter
monitoring, beam position monitors (wire chambers of fibre detectors in
the beam to measure position and improve momentum resolution) will be
done. also cosmic veto or halo veto around beam.   For the beam counter
monitoring, it may be that the 35t Penn trigger board could be used.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{Software filtering and data transfer to permanent storage}

\fixme{\emph{KH:} Compare this to the computing section and find where best to
        implement. \emph{GB:} Point out that compression and/or further event sorting can
be done in either the artDAQ trigger farm, or the online computng farm
(run by the S\&C group).  Describe where we are on this (i.e. what
compression algorithms, etc.  experience from other experiments).
Describe how the handoff to the S\&C processes writing to permanent
storage work. Address the question of disk writing speeds.
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \subsection{Slow control}

\fixme{Maybe just a reference to the slow control section
\ref{sec:slowcontrol}.} 

\subsection{Integration/Installation}

\fixme{small section on the test centres, plan for integration.
Explain each stage}

\subsection{Quality Control}

\fixme{largely undefined - need a strategy for this soon.  Perhaps
calibration goes here?}
