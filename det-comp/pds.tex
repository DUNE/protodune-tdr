\section{Photon detection system}

The scope of the photon detector system (PDS) for the DUNE far detector
reference design includes design, procurement, fabrication,
testing, delivery and installation of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item light collection system including wavelength shifter and light guides,
\item silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs),
\item readout electronics,
\item calibration system, and
\item related infrastructure (frames, mounting boards, etc.).
\end{itemize}

LAr is an excellent scintillating medium and the photon detection
system will exploit this property in the far detector.  With an
average energy of 19.5~eV needed to produce a photon (at zero field),
a typical particle depositing 1~MeV in LAr will generate
40,000~photons with wavelength of 128~nm. At higher fields this will
be reduced, but at 500~V/cm the yield is still $\sim$20,000~photons
per MeV. Roughly 1/4 of the photons are promptly emitted with a
lifetime of about 6~ns while the rest have a lifetime of
1100--1600~ns. Prompt and delayed photons are detected in
  precisely the same way by the photon detection system. LAr is
highly transparent to the 128-nm VUV photons with a Rayleigh
scattering length of (66~$\pm$~3)~cm~\cite{Rayleigh} and absorption
length of $>$200~cm; this attenuation length requires a LN$_2$
  content of less than 20~ppm. The relatively large light yield makes
the scintillation process an excellent candidate for determination of
$t_0$ for non-beam related events. Detection of the scintillation
light may also be helpful in background rejection and triggering on
non-beam events.

The photon detection system reference design described in this section
meets the required performance for light collection for the DUNE far
detector. This includes detection of light from proton decay
candidates (as well as beam neutrino events) with high efficiency to
enable 3D spatial localization of candidate events. The TPC will
provide supernova neutrino detection. 
The photon system will provide the $t_0$ timing of
events relative to TPC timing with a resolution better than 1~$\mu$s
(providing position resolution along the drift direction of a couple of mm). 

Figure~\ref{fig:PD_overview} shows the layout for the photon detector
system described in this section. %, which will be described in the following sections.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Photon detection system overview]{PD_overview}{Overview of the PDS

\subsection{Photon detector modules}

Two styles of PDS %photon detector (PD) 
modules are being produced for ProtoDUNE-SP.  
The concepts are very similar, but differ in the number of times the LAr scintillation 
light is shifted.  

The reference design shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_RadiatorBar}
has wavelength-shifting radiator plates mounted on a wavelength-shifting light guide.
The plates are coated 
with tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) to produce blue ($430nm$) light from the $128nm$ VUV 
scintillation light.  
This blue light is absorbed by a commercially produced wavelength shifting (WLS)
polystyrene bar with Y-11 fluor.  
The bar serves as a light guide to transmit the green light to the photodetector 
mounted at its end.
The radiator plates are captive in mounting blocks that are glued to the WLS bar
at regular intervals as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_radiator_mount}.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Radiator Plate Mounting Blocks]{PD_radiator_mount}
  {Mounting of the radiator plates to the WLS bar for the reference design scheme}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{PD_radiator_mount.PNG}
\end{cdrfigure}

The alternative design uses the same photodetector and mounting, but does not have
any radiator plates mounted on it.  
Instead, the bar is made by dip-coating an acrylic light guide with a solution
of TPB, solvents, and a surfactant to produce a bar with the wavelength shifter coated
on the outside.  
This has advantages in that the expensive fluor is only on the outside where it is
needed, instead of being used as a dopant added during the casting process.  
It also has only one wavelength shifting step, and should be more efficient because
of this.  
Previous work for DUNE with this technique showed that the attenuation length, and
therefore the light yield, would suffer from the coating process, but bars produced with
the latest technique as shown in~\cite{conrad_jinst} have %been shown to have 
avoided
this problem.

A systematic investigation of promising technologies has been performed on 
many different versions of light collection techniques and guides at the 
TallBo facility at Fermilab.
A test in the summer of 2015 was conducted on the very technologies that 
were chosen for ProtoDUNE-SP. \fixme{Make Ref (DUNE DocDB 138, JINST 11 C05019)}

     %pe's / MeV 
The testing at TallBo has also been used to connect the relative detector
efficiencies to an absolute light yield that can be used to tune the simulation
yields.  
A Monte Carlo simulation of incident muons in the TallBo dewar, along with ray tracing
of the VUV photons was used to normalize the incident flux of photons impinging on the
light collection paddles.  
The light yield in the measurements were then used to determine the average detection 
probability for a given detector under test.
Light yield data for the two ProtoDUNE-SP paddle types were very similar, justifying
a larger test with additional paddles to detemine the most efficient detector 
technology and allow for further refinements.

Several tests have been performed on the light-guide paddles, and testing will 
continue through DUNE to make sure the paddles are sufficiently robust for the
required lifetime.
Light guides based on cast polystyrene and acrylic have been tested 
extensively in LN$_2$ and LAr at Indiana University and in LAr at Fermilab.
No crazing or degradation even after multiple thermal cycles has been seen.
Degradation of the TPB coating has been demonstrated due to UV light.
This was seen in exposure to fluorescent lights and direct sunlight.
Testing with filtered light %that has been filtered 
has been shown to prevent damage
to the TPB coating and will be deployed everywhere the photon detectors
could be exposed.
Additional testing for environmental degradation due to humidity and 
temperature conditions that the components could experience in transit and 
after installation, but before detector filling will continue throughout this
period to determine the required environmental conditions.

\subsection{Sensors}
The planned photodetector is a SiPM.  
The model planned for ProtoDUNE-SP is the SensL C-Series 6~mm$^2$
(MicroFB-60035-SMT) device. These SiPMs have detection efficiency of
41\%; the detection efficiency combines QE and effective area
  coverage accounting for dead space between pixels. While the
C-Series SensL SiPMs are not rated for operation below
$-$40$^{\circ}$~C their performance has been excellent for this
application. 
They have been used in several tests at Fermilab test facilities,
TallBo and Blanche, and were used for the 35-ton prototype detector
as well.  At LAr temperature (89~K) the dark rate is of order 10~Hz
(0.5 p.e. threshold) while after-pulsing has not been an
issue. Extensive testing is underway and will continue, to ensure 
that the SiPMs can reliably survive the stresses associated with 
any thermal cycling in LAr and long-term operation at LAr temperature.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{SiPM performance and testing}

All photodetectors for ProtoDUNE-SP will be subjected to testing to determine
\begin{itemize}
\item forward and reverse bias I-V curves,
\item breakdown Voltage,
\item dark current and dark count rate,
\item photodetector gain,
\item crosstalk estimation,
\item response, and
\item bias dependence of parameters.
\end{itemize}
%All SiPMs 
Each SiPM will be tested before mounting on the readout boards to determine
if the part meets the specifications in a warm test.  After mounting to
the readout board all items will be tested both warm and cold (cyrogenic 
temperature) to determine the operating characteristics as when %they will be 
installed at the ProtoDUNE-SP detector, and during QA/QC tests on the PDS modules.

In addition to these tests, the photodetectors will be tested for their
response to light signals from an LED with appropriate wavelength.
These tests will be sensitive enough to determine if one of the three SiPM
elements in parallel is not functioning.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{SiPM Lifetime}
Studies have been performed to investigate the ageing of the SiPM devices over time at 
cryogenic temperatures as a result of exposure to light.
Currently, a set of 63 devices have been tested for degradation.
The SensL Series C SiPMs showed no evidence for degradation in their 
performance in the equivalent of 250 years of exposure underground at DUNE. 
The tests investigated SiPM response, noise rate, cross-talk probability, and
gain.
Detailed test results can be seen on DUNE-doc-904. (Make a reference) 
Additional long-term testing with an expanded throughput are beginning
now.

A passive aging test was initiated in March 2015 to follow the
behavior of six SensL series C SiPMs in a simulation of the benign
DUNE environment. These SiPMs have been continuously in the
dark in LN$_2$ for over 425 days. Four properties have been monitored:
dark noise rate, cross talk probability, breakdown voltage, and gain
slope. So far, the measurements show that there
have been no significant changes in these properties during the
duration of the test.
Detailed test results can be found in DUNE-doc-905. (make a reference)

%In addition to these tests, the C series SiPMs have been used for the
%readout of modules that were built to test the relative light yield of
%different light guide technologies in the TallBo tests.  In this testing 
%An additional 80 SiPMs have been used successfully in this testing that 
%required their deployment at cryogenic temperatures in a vessel with 
%similar conditions to what they will be exposed to in the experiment.
%None of the SiPMs deployed in this way have failed.

   %  Mechanical Design Mounting 


The PDS system is configured as a set of \textit{modules} that are mounted on the APA frames.  A PDS module is
the combination of one light guide (also called a ``bar'' due to its
shape) and 12 SiPMs, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_overview}~(a).  %To enable this, the the reference design for mounting the PDs onto the
The reference design for the APA frames calls for ten PDS modules per APA, approximately 2.2-m long,
86-mm wide and 6-mm thick, equally spaced along the full length of the
APA frame, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_overview}~(b). 
The light guides are inserted into the APA frame on rails gliding on their radiator
plate mounting blocks, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_mounting_inslide.PNG}.

\begin{cdrfigure}[Diagram of PDS installation into APA frame]

The system has been prototyped and test fitted with a module at CSU 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_flat_installtest}.

  %   Mechanical Design SiPM mounting board

Each photon detector has a single SiPM mounting board with 12 surface-mount SiPMs 
mounted on the face as in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_SiPM_PCB_front}.
Four groups of $3$ SiPM elements will go to a single 
channel of readout electronics in order to reduce the cost of the readout.
The board is held close to the bar, without touching, by four screws that go into 
tapped holes on the end mounting block that is glued to the bar.  
The mounting block assembly is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_endblock_mnt}.
The circuit board also has holes at each end for mounting to the APA frame.

  %   Mechanical Design Cabling

The cabling plan for the system has one cable with four shielded twisted pairs 
connected to each SiPM mounting board via the surface mount RJ-45 connector
shown mounted on the back of the readout PCB in 
Figure~\ref{fig:PD_SiPMMountPCB_back.PNG}.

The cable bundles are installed and connected to each PD 
after the PD has been installed into the slot.
