\section{Run Plan}
\label{sec:runplan}

To formulate a preliminary run plan, we assume the hadron beam spectrum and rates are as given in Tables~\ref{tab:beampartcomp} and~\ref{tab:beampartrates}.   For the purpose of estimating the beam time request, an average trigger/data rate of 50 Hz to tape is assumed. 
For the run scenario where we take 10K beam spills (two 4.8 sec spills per SPS Super-cycle) for each momentum bin from 1 to 7 GeV/c at 1 GeV/c step, the resulting sample for the positive beam is shown in Table~\ref{tab:RunPlan}.

Similar table is also expected for the negative beam sample. In addition to the hadron beam run, there is an option to take some electron samples down to 0.5 GeV/c if requested by the physics group. Based on the current information available, the total estimated beam time needed to carry out the physics program in this proposal is on the order of 6 weeks.
