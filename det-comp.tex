In the ProtoDUNE-SP TPC, 
the six APAs are arranged into two APA planes, each consisting of three side-by-side APAs. Between them,  
a central cathode plane splits the TPC volume into two electron-drift regions, one between
each pair of facing cathode and anode planes.  A field cage (FC) must completely surround the four
open sides of the entire drift region to ensure that the electric field within is uniform and unaffected by the presence of the cryostat walls and other nearby conductive structures.
