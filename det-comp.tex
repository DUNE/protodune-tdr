\section{Overview of detector components}

\fixme{THIS SECTION IN PROGRESS}
The elements composing the detector, listed in Section~\ref{intro:detector}, include the time projection chamber (TPC), the cold electronics (CE), and the photon detection system (PDS).  The TPC components, e.g., anode planes, a cathode plane and a field cage, are designed in a modular way.  
The six APAs are arranged into two APA planes, each consisting of three side-by-side APAs. Between them,  
a central cathode plane, composed of 18 CPA modules, splits the TPC volume into two electron-drift regions, one between
each pair of facing cathode and anode planes. 
Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-overview} \fixme{get a figure} illustrates how these components fit together. 
Subsequent sections describe each component in more detail.

Table~{tab:tpc-components} lists the principal detection elements of ProtoDUNE-SP along with their approximate dimensions and their quantities.

The field cage (FC), shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fc-overview}, completely surrounds the four
open sides of the two drift regions to ensure that the electric field within is uniform and unaffected by the presence of the cryostat walls and other nearby conductive structures.
