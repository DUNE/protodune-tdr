\subsection{Overview of detector components}

\fixme{THIS SECTION IN PROGRESS}
The elements composing the detector, listed in Section~\ref{intro:detector}, include the time projection chamber (TPC), the cold electronics (CE), and the photon detection system (PDS).  Each of these elements is composed of smaller pieces, and all the components must fit together to form the whole. This section outlines how the detector is constructed by listing the components with data about their dimensions, quantities, etc., and a figure showing how they fit together.  Subsequent sections describe each component in more detail.

In the ProtoDUNE-SP TPC, 
the six APAs are arranged into two APA planes, each consisting of three side-by-side APAs. Between them,  
a central cathode plane splits the TPC volume into two electron-drift regions, one between
each pair of facing cathode and anode planes.  A field cage (FC) must completely surround the four
open sides of the entire drift region to ensure that the electric field within is uniform and unaffected by the presence of the cryostat walls and other nearby conductive structures.
