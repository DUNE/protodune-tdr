\section{The ProtoDUNE Construction Model}
\label{intro:const-model}

\fixme{(Anne) This section is from Tim B. He said it should go in 1.2 but I don't see exactly where it fits. Let's see how this chapter fills out then we can structure it properly.}

ProtoDUNE components will be designed and fabricated at construction sites in
the United States and Europe as part of the DUNE Far Detector Subsystem and
managed as WBS level 3 components of the International DUNE and US DUNE Far
Detector Projects.  Design and fabrication sites include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The University of Wisconsin Physical Science Laboratory (USA) and
Manchester University (UK) for anode plane arrays;

\item The University of Chicago (USA) for cathode plane arrays;

\item Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA), and
CERN for the TPC field cage and high voltage system;

\item Brookhaven National Laboratory and Fermilab (USA), for cold electronics;

\item Colorado State University, Indiana University, MIT, and Argonne National
Laboratory for the photon detector system;

\item Oxford University (UK) as the nexus of DAQ development;

\item CERN for the ProtoDUNE cryostat and cryogenics system.
\end{itemize}

Quality assurance and quality control procedures at the component level will
be developed and performed at the construction sites.  Assembly procedures
for the TPC will be tested at the Nova Far detector site in Ash River, MN by
team of university engineers from Duke, Minnesota, Rochester, and Wisconsin.
 All component design and fabrication sub-project tasks will be formally
reviewed at the preliminary design and construction readiness stages.

A dedicated ProtoDUNE team based at CERN will receive components from the
construction sites; repeat component tests as necessary; integrate components
into system level tests; and define, implement, and manage the installation
procedures of components into the ProtoDUNE cryostat.  ProtoDUNE liaison
personnel will work with CERN to integrate the detector into the EHN1 CERN
neutrino platform hall and its beam line.

Following installation, the CERN-based ProtoDUNE team will lead the
commissioning and operation of the detector.  A core group of detector, DAQ,
and computing experts will remain at CERN for the duration of data taking.
 International and US DUNE institutes will provide personnel and CERN for
short and intermediate terms stays to augment the team during detector
commissioning and operations.
